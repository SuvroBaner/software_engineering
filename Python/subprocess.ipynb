    "Whenever we use a computer, we are always interacting with programs like opening a browser, wrting on a word processor, or using command line interfaces. The operating system's abstraction for running a program is a process. These processes are both parent and child processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python subprocess module is used to launch child processes. Here, Python is the parent process and child could be anything from shell to the GUI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create an example. In this example we will create a simple Python program and we will use subprocess to call it. Although we don't need to call a Python program as a separate sub-process, it can as well be imported as a module but the main idea is to show how subprocess module be cross-platform in nature. \n",

    "The Python program will add the numbers with sleep time of 1 sec and print them. (A simple and a cool program)"
